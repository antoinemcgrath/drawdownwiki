 Answer: On any media wiki it is the MediaWiki:Sidebar page, in our case simply enter the URL: http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Sidebar it is found from the sidebar by clicking: Admin > Lists of pages > All Pages > Namespace = Mediawiki

  51. “And delete the “From ClimatePolitics” line on the sidebar, since those pages are now on the site”
  

#### To Do ####
**1. Appears to be many specific requests, let me know if I've understood and seperated them correctly:
1A. Create 20 Coming Attractions articles
1B. Add to Directory: 20 Coming Attractions articles. 
1C. (Infobox) Variable "Sector:" will be  "Coming attractions"
        ** Do you want "Sector" or (as with the other articles) "Solution sector:"?
1C. (Infobox) Variable "Page in book:" will show page number 
1C. (Infobox) "Book article" link from Links & references label
        **Clarity is key here: I believe what you want is to direct the variable "Links & references:" to the URLs of the original excel column "Link to Writeup, References, and Errata" as a hyperlink that displays the text "Book_article"
1C. (Infobox) rest will be blank. 

2. Directory and formatting: Delete Alphabet letters, run list together. 
**If you mean the this page: http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=Category:SolutionArticle it is a special 'Category:' page and cannot be edited that way. I can create a new page, and render a borderless table displaying articles from the "SolutionArticle" category

DONE 3. Top of all article pages: replace help text now there with these edits:
Please use these initial categories to include your research and lists of open questions and topics.
Quick help: Without establishing an account, you can “Read" this article, use the "View history" tab to see changes, and the “Discussion" tab to view conversations and opinions. When you register as a user, on the upper right of your screen, you can use the "Edit with Forms"  tab to add information and the “Discussion” tab for comments. Right now at our  [http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=Help Crowdsourcer help] link in the sidebar, you can find links to help at MediaWiki but soon we'll have our own guidance about research sources and formatting your contributions.

DONE 4. Infobox: Remove original "Solution Sector:", rename "Sector:" as "Solution sector:" & first word caps only for all labels

5. Infobox: Results for "Links & references:" should hyperlink to the current URL but display "Book_article"
**If this looks good I will write & execute a script to automate this.

6. Infobox: Results for "Technical assessment:" should hyperlink to the current URL but display "Drawdown_database_PDF"
**If this looks good I will write & execute a script to automate this.

DONE 7. Bottom of solution articles: suppressbox with text saying “Category: SolutionArticle”
**completed via http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Common.css&action=edit adding .catlinks { display: none; }

8. Felix & Antoine Work with Nithin to add new Crowdsourcer help text
Change filename for “SolutionArticle” to http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=Category:Directory_of_solutions so it displays "Directory of solutions" matching navbar link 
**Please clarify #8 seems like multiple old/completed requests merged together.

9. To wrap text around photo: Create template for homepage with sideline element for book photo image 
**By "homepage" I presume "Main page" is meant, and I don't have a clear vision of how you want it to be different.

10. Felix will ask CMD how to "freeze" the labels and the information in the infobox to all but Admin.

DONE 11. Logo: Make word "WIKI" "wiki" (all lower case)
**This logo (now created several times) is as was as first mentioned a "stand in" presumably an artistic volunteer with proper image editing software, tallent and exp. will come along.

DONE 12. Sidebar: Rename "Starting page" to "Main page"

DONE 13. Sidebar: Remove "From ClimatePolitics"

DONE 14 Remove "Edit" tab from all articles
**Completed via $wgGroupPermissions['']['viewedittab'] = false;)   
**Now that this is done, perhaps #10 is moot 
 
15. Test the "edit with form" function and troubleshoot
