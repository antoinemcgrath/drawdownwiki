5. Infobox: results for Links & referencesshould say "Book_article"

6. Infobox: results for Technical assessment should say  Drawdown database PDF

DONE 7. Bottom of solution articles: suppressbox with text saying “Category: SolutionArticle” (completed via http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Common.css&action=edit adding .catlinks { display: none; })

8. Felix & Antoine Work with Nithin to add new Crowdsourcer help text
Change filename for “SolutionArticle” to http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=Category:Directory_of_solutions so it displays "Directory of solutions" matching navbar link 
**Is this a single request or multiple requests? If the later please seperate.

9. To wrap text around photo: Create template for homepage with sideline element for book photo image 
**If this formatting preference necessary please post a quick sketch (by "homepage" I presume "Main page" is meant).

10. Felix will ask CMD how to "freeze" the labels and the information in the infobox to all but Admin.

DONE 11. (Logo take 4, is the image edit) Logo: Make word WIKI all lower case

DONE 12 Rename sidebar Starting page to Main page

DONE 13 Remove From CP from nav bar
