 50.  Admin question: Point me to where I can edit the Sidebar without needing your help so I can delete the “From ClimatePolitics” line on the sidebar, since
 Answer: On any media wiki it is the MediaWiki:Sidebar page, in our case simply enter the URL: http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Sidebar it is found from the sidebar by clicking: Admin > Lists of pages > All Pages > Namespace = Mediawiki

  We invite  you to list here any project that advances awareness, research, or deployment of Drawdown solutions! For any project, please write a short paragraph including as much of the following as you can: Name, Description,  Location, Date Started, Needs and Resources Available, URL or
  51. “And delete the “From ClimatePolitics” line on the sidebar, since those pages are now on the site”


DONE 53. Create 20 Coming Attractions articles F: YES, NOT YET DONE
DONE 54. Add to Directory: 20 Coming Attractions articles. F:Yes.
DONE 55. (Infobox) Variable "Sector:" will be  "Coming attractions"
        ** Do you want "Sector" or (as with the other articles) "Solution sector:"? F: YES, all Solutions and Coming Attractions should have the same label, 'Solutions" as you've already changed throughout.
DONE 55. (Infobox) Variable "Page in book:" will show page number  F:YES
DONE 55. (Infobox) "Book article" link from Links & references label
        **Clarity is key here: I believe what you want is to direct the variable "Links & references:" to the URLs of the original excel column "Link to Writeup, References, and Errata" as a hyperlink that displays the text "Book_article" F:YES
DONE 55. (Infobox) rest will be blank.  F:YES

DONE 56. Directory and formatting: Delete Alphabet letters, run list together.
**If you mean the this page: http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=Category:SolutionArticle it is a special 'Category:' page and cannot be edited that way. I can create a new page, and render a borderless table displaying articles from the "SolutionArticle" category.F: YES, if it's not too time-consuming to create, this will be fine. **Rendered with border, borderless table with sorting looks suboptimal


DONE 57. Infobox: Results for "Links & references:" should hyperlink to the current URL but display "Book_article"
**If this looks good I will write & execute a script to automate this. F:YES, THANKS

DONE 58. Infobox: Results for "Technical assessment:" should hyperlink to the current URL but display "Drawdown_database_PDF"
**If this looks good I will write & execute a script to automate this. F:YES, THANKS

DONE 59. Bottom of solution articles: suppressbox with text saying “Category: SolutionArticle”
**completed via http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Common.css&action=edit adding .catlinks { display: none; } F"YES, THANKS

DONE 60. Felix & Antoine Work with Nithin to add new Crowdsourcer help text
Change filename for “SolutionArticle” to http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=Category:Directory_of_solutions so it displays "Directory of solutions" matching navbar link
**Please clarify #8 seems like multiple old/completed requests merged together. F: Easier way to respond to this request: far easier is to change the navbar label from current "Directory of solutions" to  "Solution articles" so it basically matches the pages it displays  **I still don't understand the reasoning but I have now switched sidebar label from current "Directory of solutions" to  "Solution articles"

DONE 61. Felix will ask CMD how to "freeze" the labels and the information in the infobox to all but Admin. F: NO LONGER NEEDED

DONE 62. Logo: Make word "WIKI" "wiki" (all lower case)
**This logo (now created several times) is as was as first mentioned a "stand in" presumably an artistic volunteer with proper image editing software, tallent and exp. will come along. F: LOOKS FINE

DONE 63. Sidebar: Rename "Starting page" to "Main page" F: YES, THANKS

DONE 64. Sidebar: Remove "From ClimatePolitics" F: YES< THANKS

DONE 65 Remove "Edit" tab from all articles
**Completed via $wgGroupPermissions['']['viewedittab'] = false;)
**Now that this is done, perhaps #10 is moot F: YES, This is a wonderful solution.

DONE 66. (redo of #42.) Test the "edit with form" function and troubleshoot:
F: I tried to edit the test words for Afforestation we had entered. When I click on Edit with forms, the four single word items don't show up in the boxes. I tried entering new text in the boxes and it didn't display and onclicking Edit with forms, all the boxes showed up empty.. I then tried the same thing on Airplanes. This time, after entering test words, I clicked Preview and it displayed the words, but they didn't show up on exiting edit, and they weren't still there when I again clicked Edit. **I looked at many possible sources for this issue, finally I found the culprit an extra "|" within the form settings page http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=Form:SolutionArticle&action=edit
This line
"| {{{field||_talk_4|input type=textarea|rows=10}}}"
Should have been:
"| {{{field|_talk_4|input type=textarea|rows=10}}}"
It now works fine when I test it.

DONE 67. Change Maine_Page to render image inline with texts http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=Main_Page
DONE 68. Change 'Caputre' page to 'Capture', update http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=Direct_Air_Capture
DONE 69. Update directory to include/exlude Capture/Caputre http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=Directory_of_Solutions
DONE 70. Add a line above the table at "http://drawdownwiki.info/index.php?title=Directory_of_Solutions" that says "Solutions in bold contain crowdsourced information."


#### To Do ####


1) Edit buttons on "Directory of solutions", "Other Drawdown projects" & every article/page that is not withing the "Solutions category".
**Felix- What is the best way for this article and About/Donate/Crowdsourcer help to be editable only by Admin?
**AM- By default every article/page can be edited the community avid watchers can undo vandalism if it occurs, the solution is to undo things you do not want. I removed the edit button from all articles that are in the solutions category, So far as locking values/page content goes I have not done that, I can look into it but I believe you were/did going to ask CMB/others about that.
***F: I will ask them about this.

2) In category solutions template have no text  to the right of the label "Technical assessment." if the solutions is one of the "20 upcoming"
**AM- No inline queries solutions found. Hundreds of variations including the following ones have been tried. The table/smw/mw syntax for rendering links with alternative text and suppressing all text based off of a variable is difficult within MW.

| {#if:_link_assessment|[{{{_link_assessment|}}}Drawdown_database_PDF]|None.}
